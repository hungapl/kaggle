# Run example notebooks
This is a collective of notebook snippets that I found useful in public Kaggle kernel.  

1. Check out this GIT repository
2. Download AMES House Price dataset from kaggle and save the datasets in examples/_data/ folder - https://www.kaggle.com/c/stat101ahouseprice/data
3. Rename the trainng dataset to trains.csv and test dataset to test.csv
4. Start Jupyter notebook
